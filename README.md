# `home-watcher`

`home-watcher` is a Linux utility that monitors your home directory for file creation activities outside of the [XDG Base Directory Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/latest/) and logs these interactions into an SQLite database.
It's usefull for finding out which applications keep creating random files with such incredibly descriptive names such as `-6000.`, `.swo`, and `.serverauth.11972` ðŸ¤”.

## Usage

Home Watcher will need to run as root to access the Linux Audit system, but does not need any arguments.
```sh
sudo home-watcher
```
