# `home-watcher`

`home-watcher` is a Linux utility that monitors your home directory for file creation activities outside of the [XDG Base Directory Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/latest/) and logs these interactions into an SQLite database.
It's useful for finding out which applications keep creating random files with such incredibly descriptive names such as `-6000.`, `.swo`, and `.serverauth.11972` ðŸ¤”.

## Usage

Home Watcher will need to run as root to access the Linux Audit system, but does not need any arguments.
```sh
sudo home-watcher
```

## Installation

1. **Build from source**  
   Clone the repository and compile the Rust project:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/QazCetelic/home-watcher.git
   cd home-watcher
   cargo build --release
   ```
   The compiled binary will be available in the `target/release` directory.

2. **Install the binary**  
   Move the binary to a directory in your `PATH`, such as `/usr/local/bin`:
   ```bash
   sudo mv target/release/home-watcher /usr/local/bin/
   ```
   
3. **(Optional) Install the systemd service**  
   Make sure to change `<USER>` in `home-watcher.service`
   ```bash
   sudo cp ./home-watcher.service /etc/systemd/system/home-watcher.service
   sudo systemctl enable home-watcher.service --now
   ```

## Database
The database contains an `files` table with the following data:

| **Name**         | **Column**      | **Description**                                                          |
|------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **File**         | `file` ðŸ”‘       | The location of the modified file or directory                           |
| **Executable**   | `executable` ðŸ”‘ | The path of the program responsible for modifying the file               |
| **Time added**   | `added_at`      | When the file - executable entry was first added                         |
| **Time changed** | `changed_at`    | When the file - executable entry was last changed                        |
| **Total count**  | `count`         | The total amount of times the executable was detected modifying the file |
